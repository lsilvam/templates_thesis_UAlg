## how to use the template and [[MSWord|MS Word]]
### setup the template 
- The template makes use of `fields`, which allows you to just add information to the document through `Home` > `Info` such as: `author`, `title`, and `tags` (keywords); see below:
	- ![Figure-1](/00images/guide_pg2a.png)

### apply Styles
- use the Styles (`Home > Styles`) in your document: 
	- **Normal** for body text
	- **Headings** for headings (up to 3 levels its not recommended more)
		- this allows the automatic index to be built
	- **Caption**
	- ☝ avoid changing the font (or any other formatting) by selecting a portion of the text: these changes will not be propagated throughout the document; unless you need to do so
	- These are the styles:

### best way to deal with:
- **Abbreviations** can be easily made by creating a table, and place the content as you go. When you finish just sort and change the table line to white
- **Tables** preferentially use academic styled tables
	- **caption is above**
	- thick horizontal lines in the header and line at the bottom, see the example:
		- ![Figure-3](/00images/WINWORD_rZRxcZi1vS.png)
	- ❌ don't use tables as images
- **Figures** Treat them as `inline with text`, this allows the images to flow with text, thus avoiding frustration of images not being in the correct (or expected) place; see below:
	- **caption is below**
	- ![Figure-4](/00images/guide_pg2b.png)
### keep attention to
- **Page and section breaks**
	- page breaks do not create a blank page between the break
	- section breaks allows different header and footer layouts (which includes the page numbering)
		- ![Figure-5](/00images/slice_pg3.png)
	- to see where the page breaks are go to `Home > Paragraph > Show all` 
		- ![Figure-6](/00images/WINWORD_GQ2LRNfuQi.png)
## troubleshooting:
- faulty fields, strange characters, etc...: select, and press Alt+F9
	- e.g. this is when some captions are not well numbered and  error occurs
- [[EndNote]] not placing citations: disable tracking changes
	- `Review > Changes > Accept all change and stop tracking`
		- if you agree with the change of course
